# Community Journaling Website Futureproof 
By  Amita, James, Medyen, Rorie    
(Team CHIRP)   


### Project Brief 

To create a community journaling website similar to a blog post which will be hosted via github pages or similar. Addtionally, The website should not have a database connected, instead any data is sent and stored in the backend within .json files.   

The Website should have the following functionality for users:  

* Be able to visit the website and anonymously post journal entries.
* Should be limited to how many characters they can put in an entry.
* Users should be able to post gifs from giphy in an entry.
* View other peoples' entries
* Have three emojis whereby users can utilise to react to other peoples’ entries with an emoji.
* Be able to comment on other people’s entries.  


### CHIRP

Hosted at: https://mysterious-brushlands-61855.herokuapp.com/

Is a microblogging system created that lets users post messages (with a maximum of 256 characters), reactions and GIFS. A platform where interaction and engagement from other users exists through the COMMENT feature. All data inputs are stored locally via JSON database so users are able to review their "chirps".
